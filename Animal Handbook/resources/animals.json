Opossums have 50 teeth, more than any other North American land mammal, and opposable, clawless thumbs on their rear limbs.\n\nThe Virginia opossum is noted for reacting to threats by feigning death. This is the genesis of the term 'playing possum', which means pretending to be dead or injured with intent to deceive. In the case of the opossum, the reaction seems to be involuntary, and to be triggered by extreme fear. It should not be taken as an indication of docility. It lies on its side, mouth and eyes open, tongue hanging out, emitting a green fluid from its anus whose putrid odor repels predators.\n\nOpossums are omnivorous and eat a wide range of plants and animals such as fruits, grains, insects, snails, earthworms, carrion, snakes, birds, mice, and other small animals",

As a result, players should be extra careful when travelling into areas where panthers are most commonly found.\nThe Eagle Eye is extremely useful in this situation, as panthers in the forest are relatively difficult to detect.\nAvoid letting a panther come too close as it is a very agile predator which can swiftly kill players at close range.\n\nThe safest method to hunt panthers is by killing it from a distance. For example, placing predator bait in an open area to lure a panther out and then shooting it with a scoped rifle.\nAlternatively, players might choose a bolder method by using themselves as bait. To do this, players must keep their weapon (bow or rifle) drawn, then ride their horse into the hunting area. Once a panther is spotted, it is crucial that you shoot it as quickly as possible.\n\nIf farming a pristine panther for the Kit Satchel, Achievements or Trophies:\nOld Harry Fen is far more likely than East of Lagras to actually have panthers (either regular or Florida), but even so, will only have one around for the player to fight each time they arrive to the region, and a new one will not spawn until the player reenters from very far away or uses the save-quit-reload strategy.\nKilling the panther cleanly for a high-quality pelt requires a rifle with e.g. an express cartridge or split point cartridge, or an improved arrow, but care must be taken not to damage the pelt, so a headshot is required. Explosive ammunition will reduce the quality to 1-star.\nPanthers tend to spawn between 10.30pm and 11.30pm.\nIf players are going for the achievements/trophies, they can hit panthers in the back of their torsos with a poisonous throwing knife or a poisonous arrow. This way they can stop their attacks and break down on the ground. Once on the ground the player can study them easily and finish them off with their knife",

The Compendium photo for the Panther in-game is a melanistic jaguar, further adding to the confusion.\nTo add to the confusion even further, the Legendary variant of the Panther is called Giaguaro.\n\nThe Kit Satchel upgrade requires a perfect panther pelt.\n\nThe Panther Trail saddle (crafted from a single panther pelt at a Trapper) is arguably the best saddle in the game when it comes to speed/stamina, as it gives the following bonuses:\n-20% HP core drain\n-26% Stamina core drain\n-50% Stamina drain\n+24% stamina regeneration rate\n+2 to both top speed and acceleration",

Wolves are also scavengers and often eat animals that have died due to other causes. Wolves live, travel and hunt in packs of 3 to 6 animals on average.\n\nCompared to its closest wild cousins (the coyote and foxes), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply descending ribcage, a sloping back and a heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canines, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular.\n\nWolves have a complex communication system ranging from barks and whines to growls and howls. While they don't actually howl at the moon, they are more active at dawn and dusk, and they do howl more when it's lighter at night, which occurs more often when the moon is full",
